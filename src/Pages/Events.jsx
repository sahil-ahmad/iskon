                  <h2>Establishment of ISKCON:</h2>
                  <p> Perhaps the most remarkable success story of Srila Prabhupada is the establishment of ISKCON itself. In 1966, at the age of 70, he arrived in New York City with just a few dollars and a trunk of books. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, he tirelessly spread the teachings of Bhagavad Gita and the practice of Krishna consciousness. His dedication and perseverance led to the rapid growth of ISKCON, which has now become a global spiritual movement with millions of followers worldwide.</p>

                  <p> Srila Prabhupada's teachings and the Hare Krishna movement have had a significant cultural influence, especially in the West.

Today, the Hare Krishna mantra continues to be sung and practiced by people of various backgrounds as a means of spiritual upliftment.</p>
